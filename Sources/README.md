# ComponentEntitySystem
A component entity system based on Ash

    Super experimental

Just experimenting new ways of handling entitys in games. Is pretty much Ash with more focus in systems instead of propertys. The main goals to achive are: reusability between games, flexibility to change and good performance. 

Having a property dosen't add you automaticaly to a system like in Ash, of course that adds extra work, but enables you to change behavior without thinking of properties.
